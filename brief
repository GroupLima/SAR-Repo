CLIENT MEETING

INTRODUCTION: PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES
	The purpose of this project is to improve the previous version of Search Aberdeen Registers (SAR) (https://sar.abdn.ac.uk/#homepage). We aim to improve upon the version created in 2017. We will recreate the search tool using PHP, aligning with current practice, and aiding future support and maintenance. The front end of the webpage will be developed using JavaScript and CSS. GitHub will be the source code repository and version control, and PHPUnit will be the testing framework.
