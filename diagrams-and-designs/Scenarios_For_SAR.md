<ins>Scenario: Making a Presentation on Scottish Law</ins>

Alma is preparing a presentation for her upcoming seminar on Scottish law in the late Middle Ages. She logs into SAR to find records of inheritance disputes. She quickly navigates the intuitive interface and uses keywords related to her research topic. The advanced filtering options allow her to refine her search by date and type of record, which she finds helpful. After finding the relevant entries she wants to include in her presentation, she clicks the self-explanatory 'Add to selected' button. Once Alma has found some relevant entries, she goes to the 'View selected' page, which she easily found due to it being signposted as she started selecting entries. Then downloads them as a pdf and uses them in her presentation and closes down the application, happy to have found what she was looking for.
