              <p>The Aberdeen Registers Online (ARO) corpus is a comprehensive digitised transcription of the first eight volumes of the Aberdeen Burgh Registers, the oldest surviving civic government records in Scotland. Spanning 113 years from 1398 (volume one) to 1511 (volume 8) these records detail a wide range of civic and legal activities including court proceedings, ordinances, elections, dispositions of property and correspondence.</p>

              <p>They provide precious insights into the lives, laws and customs of people living in 14th-century Aberdeen.  These books contain the earliest and most comprehensive archive of civic government records in Scotland and as such give historians the unique opportunity to trace and analyse patterns in the legal proceedings, governance, and social order of an urban city in the late Middle Ages.</p>

              <p>This version of the <b>Search Aberdeen Registers</b> historical search tool has been developed by Team Lima as part of the third-year Software Engineering course at the University of Aberdeen. Building on the foundation of a 2017 project created in collaboration with the Lost Aberdeen Court Records (LACR) team, our updated tool enhances search functionality and user experience.</p>
