<!-- SASS people please read!
      I have used ids, rather than classes, to identify each form option, because the purpose of ids is to identify single, unique elements.
      Hopefully its enough so that the search class people can link it all together.
      Classes are for grouping multiple elements together so i used them to identify areas that might have similar styling and behaviour to
      each other. -->
