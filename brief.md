### CLIENT MEETING

### INTRODUCTION: PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES (fariha)

This project aims to improve the previous version of Search Aberdeen Registers (SAR) (https://sar.abdn.ac.uk/#homepage), which was created in 2017. We will recreate the search tool using PHP, aligning with current practice and aiding future support and maintenance. The front end of the webpage will be developed using JavaScript and CSS. GitHub will be the source code repository and version control, and PHPUnit will be the testing framework.

This tool is for the Aberdeen Registers Online organisation. It will allow users to search blah blah

### TARGET AUDIENCE AND INTENDED USAGE (rebekah)

The primary audience of the webpage and search tool includes academic researchers and students with specific interest in the topic. The secondary audience includes non-specialists who have a general interest in the records and transcripts.
