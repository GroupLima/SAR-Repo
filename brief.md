### CLIENT MEETING

___
### INTRODUCTION: PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES (fariha)

This project aims to improve the previous version of Search Aberdeen Registers (SAR) (https://sar.abdn.ac.uk/#homepage), which was created in 2017. We will recreate the search tool using PHP, aligning with current practice and aiding future support and maintenance. The front end of the webpage will be developed using JavaScript and CSS. GitHub will be the source code repository and version control, and PHPUnit will be the testing framework.

This tool is for the Aberdeen Registers Online organisation. It will allow users to search blah blah

- rough summary of general goals and objectives goes here (scope)
	- i.e improve upon 2017 version
	- use php instead of ruby
- who the tool is for (jackson)
- who lima is (project manager, product master, scrum master, other roles?)

___
### TARGET AUDIENCE AND INTENDED USAGE (rebekah)

The primary audience of the webpage and search tool includes academic researchers and students with specific interest in the topic. The secondary audience includes non-specialists who have a general interest in the records and transcripts.

We will keep in mind that some of these users are novices at technology.

- experts in the field, but may be novice technology users

### PROJECT TIMING

The stance chosen to carry out this project is that of the agile philosophy. Following this concluded that the one (1) week sprints are most appropriate length given both the time-frame and other responsibilities to our coursework. This layout will give us the best environment to perform at our optimum. Our sprint planning sessions will be had every Monday at 16:00 P.M. and further into the week, the classic sprint workflow will be kept to. Each iteration will allow us to incrementally progress towards a deliverable product for the client, for which we will have a further three (3) sprints for.
